wave interference
=================

#### A visualisation of wave interferences.

This [html page](https://joeiddon.github.io/waves) allows you to visualise the interference between two waves.

It is especially useful for seeing the conditions for a standing wave.

The JS code implements a solution to the wave equation, seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave.
